Hi there! I’m Yadong Huang, a recent graduate in Computer Science and Technology from Changzhou University. My main interests are in embedded systems, robotics, and AI applications. Throughout my studies, I’ve gained a lot of hands-on experience and have been fortunate to win several awards in national and provincial competitions like the National Undergraduate Electronic Design Competition and the RoboMaster Robotics Competition.

During my time at university, I worked on projects like developing an embedded system for a robotic hand, where I focused on controlling miniature motors to improve precision and dexterity. For my bachelor’s thesis, I designed an autonomous navigation system for quadruped robots, using lidar and machine vision to achieve accurate localization and navigation.

I’ve also had the chance to lead teams, particularly in the RoboMaster competition, where I was involved in projects ranging from vision-based targeting to drone development.

Outside of work, I’m passionate about animals, enjoy playing Texas Hold'em and other board games, and I’m an avid eSports enthusiast.

Feel free to browse my website to learn more about my work and projects. I’m always open to connecting with others who share my interests!
